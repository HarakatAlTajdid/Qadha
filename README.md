## Easily seek Allah's forgiveness
Qadha is a free mobile app for making up missed islamic prayers. It allows you to track any prayer you recall missing in the past, using a flexible calendar system. Throughout your experience, new stories - either a verse or a sahih hadith - will be unlocked. Every prayer you make up is securely saved in order to constitute useful activity reports.

We are working in implementing newer features and translations. We need your help!<br><br>
